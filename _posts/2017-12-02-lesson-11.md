    <td>I had learnt a lot of stuff during this IT lesson. George and I were using the electric component kit. This was a a very difficult task to do as it was our first week in using the electric component kit. It was quite hard at first, but when you understand the instructions on the booklet it is really easy. George and I had taken photos but I did not know how to add them to my weekly blog posts. I tried to add them in the IT club but I did not get any help from anyone. I also think that it is very hard to work on something when none has told you how to do it. So I do not think I can add the pictures unless I get help from someone.</td>

    <td>I think that I need to ask for help more often. As I said in the box before that noone had showed me how to add pictures into your blog.</td>
