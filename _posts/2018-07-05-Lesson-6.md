    <td>I was quite slow this lesson and I did get around two badges so I thought I did pretty well and if I keep going I can finish python. I did some work but not as much as I would normally do. I also had lots of struggles and hardships whilst doing this. <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zt6iofQuV_hDNntxgf24JcKEGZYcdvm7/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

    <td>I need to work on a little bit more pace and be quicker when coding. I should follow sir's instructions a bit more and should try to listen more. Also I should try to focus more.<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bkBVCX8eL87B99UtK9JaxbJCiRpLsCSl/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
