    <td>I was quite slow this lesson and I did not get even one badge completed. I did some work but not as much as I would normally do. I also had lots of struggles and hardships whilst doing this. There was not much source of help as Mr Ampah Korsa was not in this lesson.</td>

    <td>I need to work on a little bit more pace and be quicker when coding. I should follow sir's instructions a bit more and should try to listen more.</td>
