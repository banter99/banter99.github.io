    <td>I was told by Mr Ampah Korsa to change my background to a semi transparent one and that is what i did. Also i was told to change my tables to semi transparent as well and I did that. There was another crucial thing that i was instructed to do was to add more content. This is a very important aspect because it will show me where i have gone wrong and show me my strengths as well. This will help me a lot in future life.</td>
