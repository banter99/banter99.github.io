    <td>I think that the lesson went pretty well. I put my head down and started working, this time I got two badges this lesson. I had got through lots of code carefully reading the examples and questions and managed to actually do well. Although there were a few things we had to go over at the start of the lesson. For example Mr Ampah Korsah had to go round the class and check everyone's blogs and some people including me had failed to get their blog fixed. The reason for this was because I did turn up to the IT club for extra help but then it got shut down. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on asking for help from a teacher and if I have a problem I need to fix it. In future this will help me and get me better grades in other subjects as well. For example if I am struggling in a particular topic in a subject It is my responsibility to fix it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I can listen to instructions a bit more and if I do so then I will be able to do better in IT. For example if I listened to sir then I would not have got into trouble and would be doing fine in IT.</td>
