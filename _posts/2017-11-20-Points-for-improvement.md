    <td>i need to add a background and  add a lot more content .i also need to fix my one which into long. I really want a good grade and to get this grade I have to be quiet when sir is talking not being disruptive. I also think that full achieve a good grade in this particular task you need to have a partner that can listen to you and also take in count of what you are saying. This will help me a lot and my partner right now is very helpful and kind.</td>
